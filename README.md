##Usage

###Definitions

`smallView` The small view in the presenting view controller we are transitioning from.

`largeView` The large view in the presented view controller we are transitioning to.

`viewsToFadeIn` The views in the presented view controller that fade in at the end of the transition. (Optional)


###Example

In the presenting view controller, initialise a property for the transitioning delegate:

    self.transitioningDelegate = [MZMaskZoomTransitioningDelegate new];

Assign the `smallView` and `transitioningDelegate` in `prepareForSegue:sender:`:

    - (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender
    {
      self.transitioningDelegate.smallView = sender; // The view you are transitioning from.
      ...
      segue.destinationViewController.transitioningDelegate = self.transitioningDelegate;
      segue.destinationViewController.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationCustom;
    }

Implement the `MZMaskZoomTransitionPresentedViewController` protocol in the presented view controller:

    @synthesize largeView, viewsToFadeIn;

    - (NSArray *)viewsToFadeIn
    {
      return @[self.label1, self.label2, self.label3]; // Any views you want to fade in at the end of the transition.
    }

    - (UIView *)largeView
    {
      return self.someLargeView; // The view you are transitioning to.
    }

###Other options

`duration` Default duration is 0.25 seconds.

`presenting` Default is YES. It's set to NO when dismissing a view controller (see `MZMaskZoomTransitioningDelegate`).

`dismissToZeroSize` Default is NO. Set to YES if you want the dismiss transition to shrink the view down to zero. This is useful if the `smallView` in the presenting view controller is no longer visible (e.g. item was deleted).


##Installation

###CocoaPods

To install via CocoaPods, add to your podfile:

    pod 'MaskZoomTransition', '~> 0.1'
